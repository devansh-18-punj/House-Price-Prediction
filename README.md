<h1>House Price Prediction Project</h1>
This project aims to predict the prices of houses based on certain features like area, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms. It utilizes a machine learning approach using the scikit-learn library in Python.

<h2>Dataset</h2>
The dataset used in this project contains information about houses including features such as area, bedrooms, bathrooms, and their corresponding prices.

<h2>Dependencies</h2>
Python 3.x
pandas
scikit-learn
<h2>Installation</h2>
<h3>Clone this repository:</h3>
bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/house-price-prediction.git
<h3>Install dependencies:</h3>
pip install -r requirements.txt
<h2>Usage</h2>
Prepare your dataset: Ensure your dataset is in CSV format and includes columns for features (e.g., area, bedrooms, bathrooms) and the target variable (price).
Modify the code: Update the file path and column names in the Python script according to your dataset.
<h3>Run the code:</h3>
Copy code
python house_price_prediction.py
<h2>Results</h2>
The model is trained using linear regression and evaluated based on Mean Squared Error (MSE). Additionally, you can input custom feature values to predict the price of a house.

<h2>Future Improvements</h2>
Experiment with different machine learning algorithms (e.g., decision trees, random forests) to improve prediction accuracy.
Perform feature engineering to extract more relevant information from the dataset.
Explore hyperparameter tuning techniques to optimize model performance.
